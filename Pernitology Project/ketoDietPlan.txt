		<h1>Keto Diet 7-Day Meal Plan</h1>
		<p>
			Most people can consume up to 50g total carbohydrates per day and maintain ketosis. This sample 7-day keto diet plan, with an average of 20.
			5g net carbs per day, will show you how to eat right, not less, with Atkins keto while still enjoying a variety of satisfying foods.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Day 1: Monday</h3>
			<p>Total net carbs: 20.7g</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Breakfast (4.6g net carbs): Eggs Scrambled with Sautéed Onions and Cheddar Cheese</li>
			  <li>Snack (2g net carbs): Atkins Peanut Butter Fudge Crisp Bar</li>
			  <li>Lunch (5.8g net carbs): 6 oz deli ham over 2 cups mixed greens with ½ Hass avocado, 5 large black olives,
				½ cup sliced cucumbers, and 2 Tbsp blue cheese dressing
			  </li>
			  <li>Snack (4.5g net carbs): 3/4 medium zucchini cut into sticks and 2 oz provolone cheese</li>
			  <li>Dinner (3.8g net carbs): Baked Catfish with Broccoli and Herb-Butter Blend</li>
			</ul>  
			
			<p>
				Keto tip of the day: Low carb diets like Atkins keto have a diuretic effect, so make sure you’re drinking at least 6 to 8 glasses 
				of water each day. Not consuming enough water—especially when starting a new low carb diet—can lead to constipation, dizziness, 
				and sugar/carb cravings. Also make sure you add extra salt to your diet in order to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes. 
				Try sipping on full-sodium broth or adding a little extra salt to your food.
			</p>
		<h3>Day 2: Tuesday</h3>
			<p>
				Total net carbs: 20.6g 
			</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Breakfast (5g net carbs): Atkins Frozen Farmhouse-Style Sausage Scramble</li>
			  <li>Snack (4.4g net carbs): 1 cup sliced red bell pepper with 2 Tbsp ranch dressing</li>

			  <li>Dinner (3.2g net carbs): 7 oz bone-in pork chop with Cauliflower-Cheddar Mash</li>
			</ul>  
		
		<p>
			Keto tip of the day: Get moving! Exercising regularly can help you achieve ketosis by aiding your body in using up its excess glucose 
			before storing as glycogen. It’s normal to feel a bit sluggish when starting a keto diet, so if you’re new to the low carb lifestyle, 
			stay active with low-intensity movement like yoga and walking. When you’re feeling more energized, add in some high-intensity exercise a few days a week. 
		</p>
		<h3>Day 3: Wednesday</h3>
			<p>
				Total net carbs: 19.7g
			</p>

			<p>
				Keto tip of the day: If you are new to a low carb lifestyle, you might start to come down with what’s known as the keto flu. A term coined by the keto community, 
				this is a temporary side effect experienced by some people when they start the keto diet. If you are experiencing headaches, weakness, and poor concentration,
				don’t throw in the towel! Electrolytes and water are quickly depleted when you first start a keto diet, so make sure you are drinking plenty of water and 
				consuming a little extra sodium and potassium. It also helps to get adequate sleep and make sure you are eating plenty of healthy fats.
