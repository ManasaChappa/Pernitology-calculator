		<h1>GM Diet Plan</h1>
		<p>
			The GM diet consists of a 7-day meal plan. Each day focuses on a specific food or food group.
			GM stands for General Motors. Some sources claim that the General Motors corporation developed and endorsed this diet plan to help its employees lose weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			People following the GM diet eat a different food group or combination of food groups each day. The main foods that the GM diet allows include fruits, vegetables, meat, and milk.
		</p>
		<p>
			The plan instructs people to eat a big breakfast, a moderately sized lunch, and a light dinner. It also allows several snacks throughout the day.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, the diet involves a broth called "wonder soup," which is a tangy, low-calorie vegetable soup containing cabbage, tomatoes, celery, pepper, and carrots. People can eat wonder soup as a snack to curb hunger pangs until their next meal.
		</p>
		<p>
			The plan recommends that people drink a lot of water to promote proper digestion and prevent them from feeling tired. The plan recommends 2–3 glasses of water with each meal. There is no absolute recommendation for the total amount of water to drink per day, which depends on a person's age, body weight, and overall health.
		</p>
		<p>
			People following the GM diet can take part in light forms of exercise, such as yoga, while dieting. After day 3, they can add walking or other low-intensity cardio to their workouts. On days 5 to 7, people can start adding strength training to their exercise regimen.
		</p>
